Frontend task

I have taken the element sizes from the psd file.
I didn't have the same fonr so I used a close one - from google webfonts: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald (normal and bold).
I have included modernizr and normalise.css to normalise the base element styles for all browsers.
My code in main.css in under the Author's custom styles comment.
